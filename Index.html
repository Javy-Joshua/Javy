    <h2>Brief History</h2>
    <pre style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
        My name is <b>Joshua Victory</b>. I'm from Kogi State.

    <h2>    My Aspiration</h2>
    <pre style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: oblique;">
        I learnt a little bit about C++ and python back in the 
        University. After my service I worked for a bit but had 
        to quit to focus on tech because I got scholarship into
        a blockchain program sponsored by Domineum Blockchain in 
        collaboration with NITDA and had to prepare for an entrance
        assessment into AltSchool Africa(<a href="https://altschoolafrica.com"target="_blank">WWW.altschoolafrica.com</a>).
        My friend Biti gave me this assignment, he is kinda my mentor(shh!!).
